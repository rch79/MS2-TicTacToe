# Tic-Tac-Toe

This is a simple 2-player (local) Tic-Tac-Toe game. The users select whether player 1 will be using 'X'  or 'O' on the main page. The remaining shape is assigned automatically to player 2. At the end of each round the winner gets a point. No points are assigned if the round ends in a tie. The game continues ad infinitum until players are tiredd.

### Features Left to Implement

- A Forms page, which would allow site users to search for and download an assortment of financial forms used on many Finance-related tasks in the University (ie, PO request form, petty cash request form etc).
- A Policies page, which would provide site users with links to the varous financial policies in use by the University.


## Testing 

All hyperlinks were tested to see if they are working properly. Internal links open in the same tab. External links (in the footer) open in a new tab.

Google Chrome developer tools were used to test resposive design. All three pages scale correclty on the following screen sizes:

  - Moto G4 (360 x 640)
  - Galaxy S5 (360 X 640)
  - Pixel 2 (411 x 731)
  - Pixel 2 XL (411 X 823)
  - iPhone 5/SE (320 x 568)
  - iPhone 6/7/8 (375 x 667)
  - iPhone 6/7/8 Plus (414 x 736)
  - iPhone X (375 X 812)
  - iPad (768 x 1024)
  - iPad Pro (1024 x 1366)
  - Surface Duo (540 x 720)

Both pages have been checked for horizontal scroll bars produced by overflows (on all scree sizes).

### Unfixed Bugs

You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed. 

## Deployment

- The site was developed using the Windows 10 version of Sublime Text, in conjunction with the Github Desktop client
- The site was deployed to Github Pages using the following steps:
  - In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab 
  - From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
  - Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.
